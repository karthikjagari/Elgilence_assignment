#Performance Analysis Report Generator
This project generates a well-structured performance analysis report from an Excel file containing user performance data. The report is saved in PDF format and includes individual user performance as well as a visual representation of group performance categories.

#Features
Individual Performance: The script provides detailed user performance data, including scores in various segments such as listening, speaking, reading, writing, and domain specialization. It also categorizes each user into performance groups such as "Pro User", "Mediocre User", or "Under Average User."

Group Performance: A summary of group performance is provided in a visual format, with a bar chart representing the distribution of users across the three performance categories.

Automated PDF Generation: The script automates the creation of a PDF report using the FPDF library, ensuring consistency and saving time.

Data Visualization: A bar chart showing the distribution of performance categories is generated using matplotlib and included in the PDF.

Requirements
Before running the script, make sure you have installed the required Python libraries:



pip install pandas matplotlib fpdf
How to Use
Place the Excel file with the user performance data in the same directory as the script.

Update the file path in the script to point to your Excel file:


file_path = 'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx'
Run the script using your preferred Python environment:


python performance_report_generator.py
The script will generate the following files:

performance_distribution.png: A bar chart representing the group performance distribution.
performance_analysis_report.pdf: The final PDF report with individual user data and the performance distribution chart.
Code Overview
Data Loading:

The script uses pandas to load the Excel file and extract necessary columns such as user name, email, performance, and scores in different segments.
Performance Categorization:

The categorize_user function classifies users into three categories: "Pro User", "Mediocre User", and "Under Average User" based on their performance scores.
Data Visualization:

A bar chart is created using matplotlib to visualize the distribution of users in different performance categories.
PDF Generation:

The FPDF library is used to generate a well-formatted PDF report. Each userâ€™s performance is listed in a tabular format, followed by the performance distribution chart.
Example Output
The final PDF report includes:

A summary of individual performance data.
A performance category chart showing the distribution of users.
Future Enhancements
Add pie charts or other chart types for deeper insights into the data.
Enhance the layout of the PDF to include more detailed feedback for each user.
Provide the option to export reports in other formats like PowerPoint or Word.
